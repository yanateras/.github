(devi)  
you could say anything that you want  
you could say anything that you want to  
you could say anything that you want  
you get to choose  
choose what matters to you  
you could say anything that you want  
I could say anything that I want to  
you could say anything that you want  
it's up to you  
to choose what's important to you

(rook)  
but don't be weird, don't be mean  
you're on my computer screen  
it's my world, it's my life  
i'm a person  
please be nice

(devi)  
I thought it was easy  
but everyone killed me  
I'm dead in the ground

(rook)  
i don't even know who you are

(devi)  
I breathe in so deeply  
the spring breeze kissing all my wounds

(rook)  
please be nice it's really not that hard

the sun is rising over my grave again  
i promise you'll be okay  
if i'm not your friend

you can say anything you want  
you can say anything you want to  
it doesn't mean you're bad  
but sometimes love is holding back

(rook+devi)  
you can  
you can say anything you want  
you can  
you can say anything you want to  
(rook)  
it doesn't mean that you're bad  
(devi)  
that you're good  
(rook)  
but  
(rook+devi)  
but sometimes love is holding BACK

(rook+devi)  
but don't be weird, don't be mean  
you're on my computer screen  
it's my world, it's my life

(devi)  
she's my world, she's my life

(rook)  
i'm a person  
please be nice

(devi)  
I THOUGHT IT WAS EASY  
BUT EVERYONE KILLED ME  
I'M DEAD IN THE GROUND

(rook)  
i don't even know who you are

(devi)  
I BREATHE IN SO DEEPLY  
THE SPRING BREEZE KISSING ALL MY WOUNDS

(rook)  
please be nice it's really not that hard
